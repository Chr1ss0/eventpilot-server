### Description

## Express Server with Mongoose in TypeScript

This Express server, developed using TypeScript and integrated with Mongoose, serves as a robust and efficient platform for handling geographical data. One of its prominent features is its integration with a Geo API, allowing it to effortlessly convert zip codes into precise geo data. This functionality empowers location-based services and provides enhanced geographical context to your application.

Additionally, to ensure the integrity and coherence of the MongoDB database, a custom data generation program has been implemented. This program creates fake user, organizer, and event data, facilitating thorough testing and seamless integration with the server.

The server excels in data manipulation with sorting, searching, and filtering functions. It streamlines data retrieval and presentation, optimizing user experiences. Its robust error management ensures that issues are gracefully handled, offering a smooth and secure user interaction.

In summary, this Express server, backed by Mongoose and TypeScript, is a dynamic and versatile platform designed to provide extensive support for geographical data, efficient data management, and comprehensive error handling, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications.
